# Common code for the Black Magic Probe Firmware for WeAct Studio F401CC/F401CE/F411CE boards

This code allows using a [Black Pill F4](https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.MiniSTM32F4x1) as a Black Magic Probe.

This directory contains the common code for the following platforms:
- [blackpill-f401cc](./../../blackpill-f401cc/README.md)
- [blackpill-f401ce](./../../blackpill-f401ce/README.md)
- [blackpill-f411ce](./../../blackpill-f411ce/README.md)

In the example command lines for building and flashing the firmware to the Blackpill, 'xxxxxx' is used and should be replaced with one of the following:
	f401cc
	f401ce
	f411ce

## Instructions for build system

### Variant with meson and BMD bootloader enabled (default)

0. Clone the repo and libopencm3 submodule, install toolchains, meson, etc.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic.git
cd blackmagic
```

1. Create a build configuration for specific platform (WeActStudio F401CC, F401CE, or F411CE) with specific options (enable BMD bootloader flags and offsets -- this is the default)

```sh
meson setup build --cross-file=cross-file/blackpill-xxxxxx.ini -Dbmd_bootloader=true
```

  Note: While the above command uses the 'build' directory, the name used is arbitrary, meaning, should a user wish to have multiple platforms built, they may use a more descriptive folder name.

2. Compile the firmware and bootloader

```sh
ninja -C build
ninja -C build boot-bin
```

### Firmware upgrade with dfu-util

- Install [dfu-util](https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net).
- Connect the Black Pill to the computer via USB. Make sure it is a data cable, not a charging cable.
- Force the F4 into system bootloader mode:
  - Push NRST and BOOT0
  - Wait a moment
  - Release NRST
  - Wait a moment
  - Release BOOT0
- Upload the bootloader
```sh
dfu-util -d 0483:df11 --alt 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D build/blackmagic_blackpill_xxxxxx_bootloader.bin
```
- Force the F4 into system bootloader mode:
  - Push NRST and BOOT0
  - Wait a moment
  - Release NRST
  - Wait a moment
  - Release BOOT0
- Upload the firmware:
```
./dfu-util -d 0483:df11 --alt 0 -s 0x08004000:leave -D build/blackmagic_blackpill_xxxxxx_firmware.bin
```

- Exit dfu mode: press and release nRST. The newly flashed Black Magic Probe should boot and enumerate.

For other firmware upgrade instructions see the [Firmware Upgrade](https://black-magic.org/upgrade.html) section.

### Using the BMD Bootloader
If you flashed the bootloader using the above instructions, it may be invoked using the following:
- Force the F4 into BMD bootloader mode:
  - Push NRST and KEY
  - Wait a moment
  - Release NRST
  - Wait a moment
  - Release KEY

Once activated the BMD bootloader may be used to flash the device using 'bmputil,' available [here](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/bmputil).

## SWD/JTAG frequency setting

In special cases the SWD/JTAG frequency needs to be adapted. The frequency can be set to `900k`, as this value was found to be helpful in practice, using:

```
mon freq 900k
```

For details see the [pull request](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/pull/783#issue-529197718) that implemented the `mon freq` command.


## Performance

System clock is set to either 84 MHz or 96 MHz depending on chosen platform, expecting a 25 MHz HSE crystal.

Because of low expectations to signal integrity or quality wiring, default SWD frequency is reduced to 3 MHz, but in practice 8 MHz is possible, JTAG is slower.

Aux serial runs via USART2 DMA on APB1 (Pclk = 48 MHz) at 732..3000000 baud (6Mbaud with OVER8).

TraceSWO Async capture runs via USART1 DMA on APB2 (Pclk = 96 MHz) at 1465..6000000 baud (12Mbaud with OVER8).

SPI ports are set to Pclk/8 each (use with `bmpflash`). As SPI1 pins may conflict with certain functions, and platform code does not bother restoring them, please soft-reset the probe when done with SPI operations.

## More details

* ST MaskROM is the read-only System Memory bootloader which starts up per BOOT0-triggered SYSCFG mem-remap. It talks USART AN2606 so you can use stm32flash etc. When USBOTG_FS is plugged, it spins up HSE 25 MHz and measures its frequency relative to HSI (RC 8 MHz with worse tolerance) and sometimes can misdetect it as 24 or 26 MHz then configure a wrong input PLL divider, resulting in broken USB DFU. New 8 MHz HSE boards should not be affected by this, but also they are not yet supported (needs a different pll config).
* BMD bootloader is the port of BMP bootloader with dfu_f1.c internal flash driver swapped to dfu_f4.c (and different serialno algorithm etc.) which
    a) has a fixed per-board PLL config, no autodetection;
    b) understands buttons, drives LED, does not touch other GPIOs, talks USB DfuSe, ~~has MS OS descriptors for automatic driver installation on Windows~~, uses same libopencm3 code so you can verify hardware config via a smaller binary;
    c) erases and writes to internal Flash ~2.4x faster than MaskROM;
    d) all of that in first 8-9 KiB of first page of 16 KiB (of F2/F4/F7 flash), just like on `native`/`stlink`/`swlink` etc.
